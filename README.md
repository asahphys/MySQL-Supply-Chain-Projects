This project is an SQL-based supply chain analysis using the Richard’s Supply database, which contains two years of customer orders, products, and supplier data. The analysis covers data extraction and constraints, product demand evaluation, discount and savings analysis, customer–supplier relationships by country, competitor identification, and an assessment of products for which the UK is dependent on foreign suppliers, following the requirements defined in the Supply Chain SQL case study.

This repository contains an end-to-end SQL supply chain project based on the Richard’s Supply case study, which manages food product orders from customers and supplies from multiple suppliers over a two-year period. The project includes database creation scripts, data loading, constraint definitions, and data extraction using MySQL, forming the foundation for structured supply chain analysis.

The analysis focuses on answering business-driven SQL questions such as product demand evaluation, discount and savings analysis, supplier competition, and customer–supplier relationships based on country. It also examines the UK’s dependency on foreign suppliers for specific products, with supporting documentation and a Tableau dashboard included to aid interpretation and visualization of results.
